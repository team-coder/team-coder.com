I have been developing software with different teams and for different platforms for 17 years. In September 2015 I decided that it was time to write down a few things and to share my experiences with others. I started to write this blog. My focus was on practices, technologies and soft skills that help developers to create better software with their teams.

When I started writing my first articles I realized that I didn't only help others with those experiences. I also learned a lot myself, both from really thinking about the topics and from the feedback I got from others.

Within two years I published 14 articles. Then I became a manager...

As a manager I didn't have much time for coding anymore. And it felt awkward to write about management, especially since all my employees would probably read it. It's a pity because I learned so many things in that time, so many interesting things to write about. I didn't publish any blog post in that time. I did, however, write down a couple of things and they were waiting to be published later.

In May 2020 I made a decision. I wanted to revive my blog and start writing again. I wanted to share my thoughts with the world and, most importantly, with my future self because I love reading what I learned years ago.

I started to rebuild this blog from scratch. Instead of Wordpress I used GitHub Pages with Jekyll, which is such a cool technology! In June 2020 the blog was ready - and so was I! Ready to finally start blogging again!

Meanwhile, I also published some of the articles I wrote (but didn't release) during my first management years. You can now find them on this blog, published with the date when I did actually write them.

If you want to get in touch with me, please do it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamcoder_) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertmissbach). I'm happy about any feedback, cooperation or interesting discussion that might come up!
